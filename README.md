# Mario Kart World Records

![plot shows two line graphs, side-by-side. both plots show percentage improvement in world records for mario kart 64 over time for multiple tracks first plot is for world records without using a shortcut second plot is for world records using a shortcut in both plots the same four tracks are highlighted, showing that, for those four tracks, improvements are dramatic (some way over forty percent) and seem to happen quickly, presumably as new shortcuts are discovered the world records without using shortcuts improve slowly and never reach as high as ten percent.](mario-kart.png)
